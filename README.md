# Javass3

This is the code for a fully implemented Jass Game in Java. <br>
You can play against a computer, powered by Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm, or with your friends using remote computers.

## Usage

All you need to do is to execute the Main.java file from an IDE.

Once you have executed the file, the program should run and open a graphical home screen interface. 
You then have the choice between **Master** and **Distant**.

### Master

Choose to play alone with computers, locally with multiples players or with remote computers, using their IPv4 addresses. Optional arguments can be filled in.

### Distant

Just wait for the game to start. Someone must have put you as a remote player from a Master game before.

## Export to JAR

If you want to keep it even simpler, export the Main.java into a JAR file. You can then play easily by executing this JAR file instead of opening your IDE.
